          <h4>Nut-cracking</h4>
          <p>
            Nut-cracking is a necessary process to achieve the separation of the
            nut core from its shell, aiming at the commercial exploitation of
            the kernel. Our company has state-of-the-art facilities and uses
            high-tech nut-cracking machines, meeting all EU standards and
            directives. The nuts we process include almonds, hazelnuts, shelled
            pistachios (a.k.a. Aegina pistachios), Arabian peanuts, the pits of
            stone-fruits (such as apricot) and any shelled seed, from which we
            want to extract the kernel. We offer services to producers/farmers,
            wholesalers, retailers, food companies and any other professional
            who trades nuts within Greece or abroad and is looking for excellent
            products in terms of quality and safety.

        <div>
          <h4>Standardization – Sorting</h4>
          <p>
            Sorting is a necessary post-cracking process that removes faulty
            products, foreign material or shell fragments from the processing
            line’s product stream. Following carefully established procedures,
            our experienced staff ensures the highest product quality. Also,
            standardization allows us to divide our marketable products into
            different groups based on the quality standards they uphold. Thus;
            after defining their requirements and specifications, our customers
            are sure to receive final products that meet all their needs.

          <h4>Packaging</h4>
          <p>
            Product packaging is of utmost importance and we make sure that it
            meets all hygiene requirements imposed by safety regulations and
            directives. Nuts and nut-based products are known for their high
            nutritional value but are also very sensitive when exposed to high
            temperatures or sunlight. Therefore, our company uses high-quality
            packaging materials officially certified as suitable for food
            contact. The latter are environmentally-friendly, since
            environmental protection is our priority and zero-carbon-footprint
            our ultimate goal. Our packaging varies from large wholesale
            packages for traders and food companies to HORECA-type and
            retail-ready packaging. We also use various packaging methodologies,
            ranging from simple Sealing methods to Modified Atmosphere Packaging
            using nitrogen and Vacuum Packaging.

        <div>
          <h4>Private label products</h4>
          <p>
            ‘Private label’ means that retailers can create a packaging of their
            choice, under their own brand name, controlling all product specs.
            In our company, you can either package and brand your own products
            or ask us to package our products under your brand name. We provide
            graphic design services, as we can design your product’s label or
            entire package, ensure that all labelling laws are followed and
            provide all the support and know-how you need to create a private
            label. Our partners are highly qualified and experienced and their
            work will definitely satisfy all your needs.

          <h4>Consulting services</h4>
          <p>
            Polydendros Company was founded after identifying the market’s need
            for agricultural businesses characterized by consistency, food
            safety, transparency and extroversion. Having the necessary
            experience, know-how, academic background and the right partners, we
            can offer consulting services regarding farming, agricultural
            development and investments in the agri-food sector. Aiming at the
            overall development of our country, we want to highlight the
            potential of all Greek regions, which has been discredited over the
            last decades.
