          <h4>Walnuts</h4>
          <p>
            Walnuts are the single-seed stone fruits of the walnut tree. They
            have been known since antiquity as walnut trees appear in Greek
            mythology in the form of Muses. Nowadays, they are widely praised
            for their supreme taste and proven health benefits. They make for a
            smart snacking choice but they are also used for baking (energy
            bars, florentines and more). They are a great source of healthy
            fats, protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals. Moreover, they are
            particularly rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which play an important
            role in the improvement of both brain and heart function. According
            to research, the regular consumption of walnuts can lower LDL
            cholesterol levels, have anti-inflammatory effects, and improve
            blood vessel function. When buying walnuts, look for fresh ones with
            an even color and a mild natural smell. Store them in a shady, cool,
            dry place.

          <h4>Almond</h4>
          <p>
            Almonds are the edible single-seed stone fruits of the almond tree.
            Their cultivation is part of the Hellenic tradition, since Greeks
            have been growing them for years. Today, they remain popular due to
            their pleasant taste and high nutritional value. They can be eaten
            raw, roasted, blanched or smoked and are also used for baking, as
            they are the key ingredient of numerous snacks including energy
            bars, florentines, and Greek halva. Almonds are rich in healthy
            fats, protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals. Moreover, they are high
            in vitamin E, which acts as an antioxidant, scavenging free radicals
            that can damage cells. According to research, almond consumption can
            lower LDL cholesterol levels, improve heart function, and reduce a
            person’s risk of developing type II diabetes. When buying almonds,
            look for fresh ones with even color and a mild natural smell. Store
            them in a shady, cool, dry place.

          <h4>Hazelnut</h4>
          <p>
            Hazelnut is the fruit of the hazel tree, a shrub that has been
            turned into a tree and is cultivated in many Greek regions.
            Hazelnuts have special characteristics, such as sweet taste and
            creamy texture. In ancient times, they were used in medicine due to
            their healing properties. They are rich in healthy fats, proteins,
            fiber, vitamins and minerals and a great source of antioxidants,
            including vitamin E, which protects cells from free radical damage.
            In addition, hazelnuts are also high in phenolic compounds, such as
            catechin, which has antibiotic properties and can reduce a person’s
            risk of developing numerous diseases. When buying hazelnuts, look
            for crunchy ones with a vibrant color and a mild natural smell.
            Store them in a shady, cool, dry place.

          <h4>Pistachio</h4>
          <p>
            Shelled pistachios are the seeds of the pistachio tree and are
            widely known for their refined taste and high nutritional value.
            Pistachio trees are cultivated all around Greece, and mainly on the
            island of Aegina, which has given its name to the famous local
            variety (known as Aegina pistachios). Shelled pistachios are rich in
            healthy fats, proteins, fiber, vitamins and minerals. They are also
            high in antioxidants, calcium and vitamin E, which is supposed to
            prevent cardiovascular risks. Their consumption has
            anti-inflammatory effects, improves heart health, and reduces a
            person’s risk of developing type II diabetes. In addition, studies
            have shown that regular consumption of pistachios can help reduce
            the risk of cancer. When buying pistachios, look for fresh ones with
            strong smell and flavor. Store them in a shady, cool, dry place
